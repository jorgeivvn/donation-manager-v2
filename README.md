# Donation Management System

## MVP / Description

### An app that maximizes donations given in the event of a catastrophe to prevent a surplus of supplies.

## Motivation

"Humanitarian workers call the crush of useless, often incomprehensible contributions "the second disaster."" - (https://www.cbsnews.com/news/best-intentions-when-disaster-relief-brings-anything-but-relief/)

""People still have that opportunity to choose what it is they're purchasing, so they're not just giving money to an amorphous, unidentifiable pool," says Feder."

"Part of what people are doing is they're helping, they're trying to help. What we need to figure out is how to effectively handle that," O'Hara says.
